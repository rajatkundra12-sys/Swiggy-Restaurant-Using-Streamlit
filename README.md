# 🍽️ Swiggy Restaurant Recommendation System using Streamlit

📌 Project Overview
This project is a data-driven restaurant recommendation system designed to help users discover restaurants based on preferences such as city, cuisine, rating, and cost. It uses data preprocessing, one-hot encoding, and clustering or similarity-based techniques and is deployed through an interactive Streamlit application.

🧠 Skills & Technologies Used
- Python
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- One-Hot Encoding
- Recommendation Systems
- K-Means Clustering / Cosine Similarity
- Streamlit Application Development

📊 Domain
Recommendation Systems & Data Analytics

🗂️ Dataset Information
Attributes:
- id, name, city, rating, rating_count, cost, cuisine
- lic_no, link, address, menu
Categorical: name, city, cuisine
Numerical: rating, rating_count, cost

⚙️ Project Workflow
1) Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicate records
- Handled missing values
- Generated cleaned dataset (cleaned_data.csv)

2) Data Preprocessing
- Applied One-Hot Encoding on categorical variables (city, cuisine)
- Converted all features into numerical format
- Created encoded dataset (encoded_data.csv)
- Saved encoder as pickle file (encoder.pkl)

3) Recommendation Engine
- Implemented K-Means Clustering / Cosine Similarity
- Identified similar restaurants based on user preferences
- Mapped recommendation results back to cleaned data

4) Streamlit Application
- Accepts user inputs such as city, cuisine, rating, and cost
- Processes inputs using the recommendation engine
- Displays personalized restaurant recommendations

📊 Results & Key Insights
- Successfully built a personalized restaurant recommendation system
- Data preprocessing improved recommendation accuracy
- Streamlit interface enhanced overall user experience

▶️ How to Run the Application

# Step 1: Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
